## Development Status

ðŸš§ **Project Status**: In Development

This repository is currently being set up for the WANDA telescope hardware development. The project is in the initial planning and design phase.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- CAD software (SolidWorks, Fusion 360, or similar)
- PCB design software (KiCad, Altium Designer, or similar)
- Electronics simulation tools (SPICE, LTspice, or similar)

### Contributing
1. Fork this repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/new-component`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add new component design'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/new-component`)
5. Create a Pull Request

## Documentation Standards

- All designs must include proper documentation
- Schematics should follow standard electrical engineering conventions
- CAD models must include proper dimensioning and tolerances
- Test procedures should be documented with expected results

## File Formats

### Electronics
- **Schematics**: `.sch` (KiCad), `.dsn` (Altium)
- **PCB Layouts**: `.kicad_pcb` (KiCad), `.PcbDoc` (Altium)
- **Bill of Materials**: `.csv`, `.xlsx`

### Mechanical
- **CAD Models**: `.step`, `.iges`, `.stp`
- **Drawings**: `.pdf`, `.dwg`
- **Manufacturing**: `.dxf`, `.nc`

## Testing and Validation

All hardware components must undergo:
- Design review and simulation
- Prototype testing
- Environmental testing
- Performance validation
- Manufacturing readiness review

## Manufacturing

Manufacturing files and documentation will be organized by:
- Component type
- Manufacturing process
- Supplier information
- Quality control procedures
